# Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study Project: R Project Bellabeat Case Study
Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certification Course using R programming Language

Bellabeat: What Smart Plays Can a Health Technology Business Make?

We are given the chance to do a capstone project as part of the final course of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification program to consolidate the abilities
we have learnt from the course using real-life case study.

I will use the steps of the data analysis process—ask, prepare, process, analyze, communicate, and act—to provide answers to the important business issues.

I'll be playing the part of a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech producer of health-oriented products for women, 
in this case study. I will examine, clean, and analyze the data using the R programming language to enable data-driven decision-making.

Business Tasks:
To gain insight into trends on how consumers are using non-Bellabeat smart devices to reveal more opportunity of growth and 
to help guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat’s products.
